Once the webcam is initiated, a player must follow prompts by making the corresponding hand gestures. The gestures are then detected and real-time accuracy feedback is provided to the player. If the gesture is correct, the player earns points to move through each level of gameplay. The player cannot move on to the next level until they pass the current one with 100% accuracy.
